# CitySeva WebApp Cleanup Report

## Summary
The project has been cleaned up by identifying and moving duplicate and unused files to a backup directory. This reduces clutter and makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.

## Files Successfully Moved to Backup
The following files were identified as duplicates or no longer in use and have been moved to the `backup_unused` directory:

1. migrate_categories.py
2. QUICK_FIREBASE_FIX.md
3. run_migration.py
4. simple_firebase_export.py
5. SIMPLE_FIREBASE_FIX.md
6. simple_migrate_categories.py
7. test_firebase_connection.py
8. update_app_to_firebase.py
9. verify_firebase_collections.py
10. verify_firebase_migration.py
11. check_firebase.py
12. check_firebase_credentials.py
13. direct_firebase_setup.py
14. fix_firebase_key.py
15. extract_firebase_key.py

## Categories of Moved Files

### Duplicate Migration Files
The following scripts had overlapping functionality for data migration:
- simple_migrate_categories.py
- migrate_categories.py 
- run_migration.py
- verify_firebase_migration.py

### Documentation Files
Multiple versions of similar documentation were consolidated:
- SIMPLE_FIREBASE_FIX.md
- QUICK_FIREBASE_FIX.md

### Utility Scripts
The following scripts were one-time use or redundant:
- test_firebase_connection.py
- check_firebase.py
- check_firebase_credentials.py
- direct_firebase_setup.py
- fix_firebase_key.py
- extract_firebase_key.py
- simple_firebase_export.py
- update_app_to_firebase.py
- verify_firebase_collections.py

## Restoration Process
If any of the moved files need to be restored, they can be found in the `backup_unused` directory. See the README.md file in that directory for more details.

## Benefits
This cleanup:
1. Reduces clutter in the root directory
2. Makes the project structure clearer
3. Prevents confusion about which migration scripts to use
4. Maintains all files for historical reference if needed
5. Reduces potential errors from using outdated files
