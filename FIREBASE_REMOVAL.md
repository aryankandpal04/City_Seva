# Firebase Removal Documentation

This document outlines the steps taken to completely remove Firebase dependencies from the CitySeva application and transition to a SQLite-only database system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication System
- Removed `firebase_auth` imports and references in `app/routes/auth.py`
- Implemented SQLite-based authentication with password hashing
- Created helper functions for audit logs and notifications
- Updated OTP verification to work with SQLite
- Fixed email verification flow to work without the `email_verified` field

### 2. Citizen Routes
- Removed all Firebase query logic from `app/routes/citizen.py`
- Simplified endpoints to only use SQLite queries
- Updated complaint creation and management to use SQLite models
- Modified file upload handling to store files locally

### 3. Admin Routes
- Removed Firebase-specific code from `app/routes/admin.py`
- Updated complaint management, user management, and dashboard data retrieval
- Simplified pagination to use SQLite's native pagination
- Removed unused FirestorePagination class
- Added missing `official_requests_count` in admin dashboard to fix template error
- Updated users template to work with SQLite pagination instead of Firebase documents

### 4. Email System
- Renamed `firebase_email.py` to `fallback_email.py`
- Modified email fallback system to not depend on Firebase Cloud Functions
- Updated references in `app/utils/email.py` to use the new fallback approach

### 5. Configuration
- Removed Firebase configuration settings from `config.py`
- Simplified database configuration for SQLite
- Updated environment file to remove Firebase settings

### 6. Database Migration
- Updated models to remove any Firebase-specific fields
- Modified data access patterns to exclusively use SQLite

### 7. Documentation
- Updated README.md to clearly state that SQLite is the exclusive database system
- Removed references to Firebase in documentation

### 8. Template System
- Added SQLite-compatible replacement for `get_doc_attr` Jinja filter that was previously used for Firebase documents
- Updated template rendering to work with SQLite model attributes instead of Firestore documents
- Fixed variable passing in templates to ensure all required variables are provided
- Cleaned up leftover Firebase conditionals in admin user management templates

## Files Removed
- `firebase_auth.py`
- `firebase_db.py`
- `firebase_helpers.py`
- Firebase credential files (JSON)
- Migration scripts specifically for Firebase

## Files Renamed
- `firebase_email.py` → `fallback_email.py`
- `run_with_sqlite.bat` → `run.bat`
- `run_with_sqlite.sh` → `run.sh`
- `init_sqlite_db.py` → `init_db.py`

## Configuration Changes
- Removed all Firebase API keys and configuration settings
- Simplified environment variables to only include what's needed for SQLite

This completes the transition from a dual-system (Firebase/SQLite) approach to a SQLite-only implementation.
